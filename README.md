Sorting Algorithms
=====================


A selection of sorting algorithms from a basic computer science book for the fun of it.

----------


Selection 
---------

- Start with a list of numbers
- For a given index, search for the a smaller number in the remaining items
    - If found swap the items
- Repeat until the list is processed

Insertion
---------

- Consider only the first element, and thus, our list is sorted.
- Consider the next element; insert that element into the proper position in the already-sorted list.
- Repeat this process of adding one new number for all n numbers.

Bubble
------

- Loop through all entries of the list.
- Compare each entry to all successive entries and swap entries if they are out of order.
- Repeat this process a total of n â€“ 1 times.
